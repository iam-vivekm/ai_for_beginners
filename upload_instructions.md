# How to Republish Your AI Website

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in
2. **Find your repository** (the one you used for GitHub Pages)
3. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
4. **Drag your `index.html` file** into the upload area
5. **Write a commit message**: "Republish AI presentation website"
6. **Click "Commit changes"**
7. **Go to Settings → Pages**
8. **Make sure Source is set to "Deploy from a branch"**
9. **Select "main" branch and "/ (root)" directory**
10. **Click "Save"**
11. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for deployment
12. **Your site will be live at**: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`

## If You Don't Have a Repository Yet:

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub
2. **Name it** something like "ai-presentation" or "my-website"
3. **Make it public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. **Upload your `index.html` file**
5. **Follow the GitHub Pages setup** in Settings → Pages

## Troubleshooting:

- **Check the "Actions" tab** in your repository for any build errors
- **Make sure the file is named exactly `index.html`** (case-sensitive)
- **Ensure the file is in the root directory**, not in a subfolder
- **Wait a few minutes** - GitHub Pages can be slow to update

Your website should be live within 10 minutes!
